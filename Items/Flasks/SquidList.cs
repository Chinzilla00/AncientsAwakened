1. Something from that biosphere underground. A crystal from it could work...
2. Flesh samples from the corruption. I want to see what those things are made of.
3. A bone sample from the crimson. I'm wondering how their bone structure works.
4. Find whatever the creatures in the mire eat. Just kill them until one drops its food or something.
5. A scale from something in the inferno. I'm trying to figure out how these things are so fire resistant.
6. Spore Samples from the jungle. These mushrooms are really annoying, maybe I can make something to kill them off.
7. Some kind of creature part that injects poison or something. My syringe broke and that nurse won't let me use any of hers.
8. A sample of whatever the Mushroom Monarch and Feudal Fungus are made of. I might need some help studying these, though...
9. A  piece of scrap metal from those floating islands west of here. That stuff looks interesting to make equipment with.
10. An Ice machine would be kind of nice to have.
11. Bunnies. Not for testing purposes, I just think they're cute and want a couple as pets.
12. Something sparkly from the Hallow. I wonder if I can use it to make more potions...");
